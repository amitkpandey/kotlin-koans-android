    <h1>Kotlin Koans - Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>As with many apps, we collect the e-mail addresses of those who
    communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what screens
    consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the user. This
    information is used to improve the app and never shared with or sold to
    other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or
    services you've requested, when we have your permission.</p>

    <h3>Crash logs</h3>

    <p>We send anonymized information about app crashes to a third-party server.
    This anonymized information is only ever used for analyzing and fixing bugs
    in the app.</p>

    <h3>Questions</h3>

    <p>Any questions about this privacy policy should be addressed to the
    developer of the app, whose contact details can be found in the app's Play
    Store listing.</p>
